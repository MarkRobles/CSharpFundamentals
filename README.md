# CSharpFundamentals
Following the pluralsight course by  the master Scott Allen


I haver learnt things again, like:

Encapsulation:
I can say it is a mechanism to reduce complexity of the code. Hiding the details of an specific operation and just calling that in one function, class and so on.

Reference Types vs Value Types:
  To know if a type is a value or reference type is easy. 
  Go to the definition of a type with f12, for example int type
  All types that are a class  are referece types 
  All types that a a struct a value types
    string type is referece type but behaves as a value type
    
    ref vs out keyword
    if you want to pass something by reference you must to use the ref keyword.
    if you want to pass something by reference you must to use the out if you want that assign a value to that its mandatory keyword.
